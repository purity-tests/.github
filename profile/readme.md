In today’s diverse workforce, workplace discrimination remains a pressing issue despite decades of legal reforms and awareness efforts. 

Workplace discrimination occurs when employees are unfairly treated because of personal characteristics such as race, gender, age, disability, religion, or sexual orientation.

In the workplace, the [Race Purity Test](https://racepuritytest.net/) has evolved from a justification for exclusion and segregation to essentially advocating for inclusion, equality, and dignity across all domains.

Rather than being limited by biases, this emphasizes the importance of having teams where individuals are valued and encouraged to contribute their skills and knowledge.

This article aims to help employers in successfully recognizing, preventing, and responding to workplace discrimination by highlighting major legal duties, best practices, and methods to build a fair, inclusive environment for all employees.

Workplace discrimination occurs when employees and job applicants are unfairly treated based on legally protected characteristics.

The scope of discrimination is not limited to obvious biases, as even minor behaviors or organizational practices can be discriminatory and detrimental to certain groups.

If someone's personal traits are the reason for their workplace treatment, it is not based on their skills, qualifications, or performance.

## Common Forms of Discrimination

**-** Negative treatment based on gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation includes unequal wages, unfair promotions, and harassment. 

**-** Age discrimination is commonly practiced towards older employees, but this can also apply to younger workers who are perceived as inexperienced or unqualified.

**-** When employers do not make reasonable accommodations or base employment decisions on physical or mental disabilities, disability occurs.

**-** When employees are treated unfairly because of their faith, beliefs, or religious practices, and/or when accommodations are denied for religious ceremonies.

**-** Employees who are pregnant, on maternity/paternity leave, or have caregiving responsibilities are subjected to unfair treatment.

**-** Other protected features, such as marital status or genetic information, may be included in the protection under national or local laws.

An organization's culture plays a significant role in either mitigating or perpetuating discrimination. Even well-intentioned practices can inadvertently foster bias.

**- Hiring and Evaluation:** Decisions influenced by unconscious preferences for certain genders, races, or backgrounds.

**- Performance Reviews:** Evaluating employees based on subjective criteria that may favor certain groups.

**- Communication Styles:** Valuing certain communication styles over others, leading to the marginalization of those who communicate differently.

**- Workplace Dynamics:** Encouraging behaviors or attitudes that may alienate certain groups, such as long hours that disadvantage caregivers.

**- Leadership Diversity:** A lack of diverse representation in leadership roles can perpetuate a homogenous culture and discourage diverse talent.

**- Mentorship Opportunities:** Limited access to mentorship for underrepresented groups can hinder their professional growth.

Employers must actively work to create an inclusive culture that values diversity and promotes equity.
